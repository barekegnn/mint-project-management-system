## Potential Objections & Responses

### Objection: "We don't have budget for this"
**Response**: "I understand. Let's discuss what's most important for the Ministry. We can start with Phase 1 and expand later. The ROI is less than 1 month."

### Objection: "We need to think about it"
**Response**: "Absolutely. Take your time. I'm happy to answer any questions or provide more information. When would be a good time to follow up?"

### Objection: "We already have a system"
**Response**: "That's great. How is it working for you? What challenges are you facing? Maybe we can help improve it or provide a better solution."

### Objection: "This seems too good to be true"
**Response**: "I understand your skepticism. Let me show you the code, the deployment, the testing. Everything is transparent. You can verify everything yourself."

### Objection: "We need to get approval from higher-ups"
**Response**: "That makes sense. I'm happy to present to them as well. Would you like me to prepare a formal proposal for your leadership?"
